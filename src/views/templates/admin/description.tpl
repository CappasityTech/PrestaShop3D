  <ul>
    <li>You need to have a Cappasity account to create, upload and synchronize 3D Views. Sign up here – <a target="_blank" href="https://3d.cappasity.com/register">https://3d.cappasity.com/register</a></li>
    <li>Sign in to your Cappasity account and generate a personal token on your Account/Security tab. Copy the token and paste it in the API token field that you will see during module installation. Now your accounts are synchronized and you can simply attach 3D Views from your account to the items in your product catalog.</li>
    <li>You can automatically synchronize your product catalog with your Cappasity account at any time. We synchronize data by comparing your catalog's reference codes with SKU numbers on the Cappasity platform. Just open the module settings and press the SYNC button on the bottom of the page.</li>
    <li>To attach a 3D View manually, you can open Catalog/Products/, select a product, select the Cappasity 3D and 360 Product Viewer and choose a 3D View from your Cappasity account.</li>
